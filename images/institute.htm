      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Barstow Institute, headquartered at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska, 
        continues the long tradition of summer Alexander Technique workshops established 
        by master Alexander teacher, Marjorie Barstow, who was the first graduate 
        of F.M. Alexander's training course in 1934. Since the early 1970's students 
        have gathered together from around the U.S. and abroad to experience the 
        unique approach that Ms. Barstow brought to the teaching of the Alexander 
        Technique, which included pioneering group teaching. Her teachings are now 
        carried on by her students, the <a href="faculty.htm">faculty</a> for the summer workshops. Due to the unique nature of the Barstow Institute, 
        and to ensure that each participant receives quality experiences, the enrollment is limited to ensure
        a low student-to-teacher ratio.</font> A student-teacher ratio of 7:1 is not exceeded.</p>
      <p>This workshop is designed both for those who are new to the Alexander 
        Technique and for anyone interested in refining their understanding and 
        practical applications of the Technique. The emphasis of this workshop 
        is on facilitating each student's ability to confidently apply the Alexander Technique 
         in all their activities. Each student will gain a greater 
        awareness of how to move efficiently while learning to free themselves 
        of unnecessary tension. The Technique is taught through verbal exchange, 
        delicate hands-on guidance, and observation.      </p>
      <p>The sessions will meet from 9 a.m. to 12 noon for discussions, presentations 
        and practice, and for small and large group work. During the afternoons 
        and evenings, special seminars are presented on such topics as: performance 
        process, speech work, lessons in <em>Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement</em>&reg;, 
        group performance work, <a href="tai%20chi.htm">Tai Chi</a>, and more. 
        Participants are also invited to present and share topics of interest 
        to the group in the evening sessions. Each student will receive one private 
        lesson per week.  <a href="day.htm">Daily schedule</a>.<br>
