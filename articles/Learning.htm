            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Twenty-five years ago 
              I read a book about the Alexander Technique. The photos and detailed 
              instructions opened my eyes to a new and exciting way of moving. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As a teenager in the 
              forties my family was always reminding me to, “Stand up straight.” 
              I would throw my shoulders back and try, but I couldn’t hold that 
              position. Soon I would be slouched down. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Alexander developed 
              a new way of instructing his students that involved a gentle movement 
              of the head before starting any physical activity. I interpreted 
              this to mean I should move my head slightly up from between my shoulders 
              and then move my torso up from my pelvic area. I felt such a lightness 
              and ease that I thought, “This is the answer to my slouching problem.” 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fifteen years later 
              I found the Performance School in Seattle. Seven dedicated young 
              persons, who had learned the Technique from Marjorie Barstow in 
              Lincoln, Nebraska, used their after-work hours and weekend time 
              to instruct others in the Technique. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I observed the miracle 
              of change in the movement of the mostly younger people who participated 
              in these classes. I could also see that learning to think through 
              changes in walking, sitting at the computer, running and other daily 
              activities gave them a look of confidence in their abilities. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those who wanted to 
              improve their talking, singing, dancing, acting or playing of a 
              musical instrument were encouraged to use the Alexander Technique 
              before starting these activities. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At age sixty my ingrained 
              habits were harder to change. The first instruction to think, “My 
              neck is free,” seemed an impossibility. Well, I did it! When I tell 
              friends to think their neck is free, they grab their neck and the 
              look on their faces says, “You’ve got to be kidding.” Believe me 
              it works. Try it! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The next instruction 
              was to think of letting my head go forward and up (the opposite 
              of the slouch). The instructors with a gentle suggestion from their 
              hands slowed me how to do this. Next was to let my body follow. 
              This was also taught was a gentle suggestion of the instructors’ 
              hands on the lower back area just below the rib cage.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Learning the Alexander 
              Technique was difficult for me. The teachers would suggest, “Let’s 
              see if we can find a better way.” But the “better” way sometimes 
              felt strange at first. They often asked, “What are you noticing?” 
              Since the Technique is based on thinking, not just feeling, I had 
              to learn to observe whether my body was moving in a more relaxed, 
              efficient way. This in turn helped sell my mind on staying with 
              the work. Learning the Alexander Technique has produced good results 
              for me not only in my physical well being but in knowing how to 
              think though changes in other areas of my life where old habits 
              have also been hard to break. I wish teenagers and senior citizens 
              could experience the benefits of the Technique. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For the first time this 
              year (1999) I was able to attend the eight-day Marjorie Barstow 
              Summer Institute at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska. At the Institute, 
              the interaction and observation of a group of learnings being taught 
              by several very different teachers was wonderful. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was a low-key, marvelous 
              experience living in a dorm, eating in the cafeteria, walking to 
              classrooms across a pleasant campus and becoming acquainted with 
              an interesting group of learners and teachers. An added bonus was 
              the option of doing early-morning Tai Chi and late-afternoon Feldenkrais 
              exercises.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Most importantly I 
              learned so much that was valuable for what I hope to do. </font></p>          </td>
