            <p>I attended the 2000 Annual Barstow Institute on the Alexander Technique, 
              which took place in Crete, Nebraska, from June 17-24, 2000. I was 
              able to learn a great deal, both about the Alexander Technique, 
              and about teaching in general&#151;all of which will be useful to me 
              in my own teaching. I grew so much as a person and a teacher because 
              I had this opportunity to attend the Institute. The teachers at 
              the Institute are highly skilled, and I made several wonderful observations 
              from watching their work. </p>
            <p>I also had one very extreme moment of personal growth while I was 
              working one-on-one with a teacher (which I will attempt to describe 
              below). </p>
            <p>During the Institute, we focused exclusively on the ideas of F.M. 
              Alexander&#151;that is, how one's neck and head relate to one's body, 
              and how every subsequent movement and action stem from this very 
              important connection. I spent a great deal of time working with 
              my movement and becoming more aware of my body in space. I also 
              worked extensively with the practicalities of excess stress. These 
              ideas are, of course, vital in theatre (and life too!), and I will 
              be able to work with my acting students more effectively because 
              my understanding of the body has been increased, and my usage has 
              improved. Because of the Institute, I can help my students to understand 
              their bodies more fully and I can work with them to better use their 
              bodies in performance. </p>
            <p>Alexander is all about finding out what it is that you are doing 
              by helping one to become more sensitive. Alexander is about thinking 
              and doing, and how your thoughts affect what you do. This is key 
              in theatre, as in all art forms, because awareness of the body and 
              its affect on an audience increase an actor's effectiveness. I further 
              posit that the ideas in Alexander, of thinking and doing, can be 
              applied to all disciplines, because our performance work on anything 
              depends on our thinking. The week was devoted to thinking about 
              my thinking&#151;and I was able to reflect on the fact that I am often 
              too product oriented, forgetting the importance of process. </p>
            <p>The biggest "ah ha" I made was this simple idea: pay attention 
              to the how instead of the what. Actually, it was more of a reminder 
              than a new thought, but I had forgotten how important a thought 
              it is! The decision to pay attention is an action in and of itself, 
              and the most important one. I was constantly reminded to make what 
              I am doing with my thinking a little bit more important than what 
              is happening. I then had the opportunity to stand back and see what 
              happened. Inevitably, the what got better!! This is very important 
              in my work with young actors because I do want them to improve. 
            </p>
            <p>I also became intrigued with one teacher's idea: that we are continuously 
              experimenting. This word, experiment, made a huge difference for 
              many of the other students at the Institute because it took the 
              emphasis off of being wrong. So often my students are afraid to 
              risk&#151;yet without risk, there is no growth. I want to work with 
              the word experiment as a way to encourage risk taking&#151; "try a little 
              experiment" seems so much easier and friendly a way to phrase direction 
              and encourages students to actually try what you are suggesting. 
            </p>
            <p>Some of the ideas and words that were frequently used during the 
              Institute included: gentle, delicate, let go, invite, notice, wishing, 
              my, I awareness, and subtle. I made a list of these because I think 
              that they will be helpful to my teaching vocabulary-inviting a student 
              to participate, for example, and the ever-important idea of awareness 
              as integral to growth of any kind. </p>
            <p>My personal growth experience involved the release of my upper 
              torso from by legs, allowing my entire body to grow "up." This release 
              eased breathing and movement. I have been waiting for this release 
              to happen for some time, as I know that I am "compressed" in my 
              torso (I can see it and feel it). It was such a stunning moment 
              that I burst into tears. I then worked on performing a monologue 
              and found a whole gracefulness of movement had opened for me in 
              a new way!! </p>
            <p>Finally, I continue to contemplate the idea that one does not have 
              to continuously evaluate what one is doing in order to make progress. 
              Often constructive thinking will help more than evaluative thinking. 
              Since young thespians frequently become trapped in the evaluation 
              process, this is an important concept. When you're checking to see 
              what you are doing, you are implying a subtle failure&#151;you wouldn't 
              be checking if it wasn't right. What happens if you leave that thought 
              out of your work while you are working? Will your progress be better? 
              The Institute confirmed this idea for me. </p>
            <p>Alexander is also about the willingness to change. Often, I get 
              stuck in a pattern that has "worked" in the past, although I know 
              that I must continue to grow. This affects my teaching and my artistic 
              work. The Institute, by focusing on my body usage (which I want 
              to change), had a greater impact on me because it reminded me that 
              change is about the whole person, not just a part, and I need to 
              remember this for my students as well. I'm not just asking them 
              to consider an idea in isolation; I may be asking them to change 
              their wholeworld-view, and this can be scary and exciting. </p>
            <p>I found the teachers most effective at the Institute. I was also 
              intrigued by the small group work that is a part of the Barstow 
              Method of teaching Alexander, and I believe I benefited from watching 
              it in action.</p>
