            <p><font size="2">The following has been adapted from an article titled <em>Exploring an Act of   Will,</em> published in <em>Journal for Anthroposophy,</em> Winter 1995, by Stacy Gehman </font></p>
            <p>I have guided many people through the process that I will describe here, and   although my approach is essentially the same in all cases, in practice everyone   is different in what they notice and what they don&rsquo;t, so that the questions I   ask and the suggestions I offer are different for everyone. Nevertheless I hope   to explain it here in a way that will help you ask yourself questions and   discover your own possibilities. I would be very happy if anyone who tries this   would write me with their experiences.</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s look at what happens when we take a step. Really we could choose any   activity, to sit down, stand up, sing a song, jump, put a bow to a string, turn   a screwdriver, etc, but for now let&rsquo;s stay with taking a step. The first thing   that I would like you to notice is how you have thought about what you are about   to do. Did you try to remember what you do to take a step, or to figure out what   you must have done? Instead I suggest actually doing it. Go ahead and take a   step, then ask yourself "what happened?" If you&rsquo;re not sure what happened, do it   again, but be sure you are really just standing there first. Sometimes simply   going back to standing requires very clearly saying to yourself, "No, I am not   going to take a step. I am just standing here." If you find you&rsquo;ve made a little   preparatory movement because you think you know you need to do that anyway, and   you can notice yourself doing it, then you are well on the road to finding out   how your habitual response to taking a step begins. In fact standing quietly,   knowing that in a moment you are going to take a step, but doing nothing in   response, can be an interesting challenge in directing one&rsquo;s will. It is the   beginning of what Alexander called inhibition, and is necessary to finding out   what your habitual response is. Some consider this consciously willed inhibition   of an immediate, habitual response to be Alexander&rsquo;s most important discovery,   because it is this that allows room for a new way of doing to be discovered. </p>
            <p>While you are standing there, are you standing absolutely still, or can you   notice very slight little movements of your head, neck, torso and legs? Those   movements are the natural movements you do to maintain balance. Can you see how   those little movements respond to your breathing, perhaps even to the beating of   your heart? Movement of the various parts of our body relative to each other is   necessary to balance. It really is amazing what all is going on all the time   that we never need to bother ourselves about. There is no way that I can help   along that process of balancing by tightening something up or holding on to my   legs, for example. I can only get in its way. The best thing I can do is to   begin to notice how I do get in its way, and stop. This goal, of finding out how   I am interfering with the easy, natural functioning of myself, so that I can   have a choice to stop interfering, underlies all of the Alexander Technique. Our   more usual approach, of identifying an end, and being concerned primarily with   gaining that end, Alexander termed "end-gaining."</p>
            <p>Now that we have gotten this far, go ahead and start to take another step.   What did you notice? Did your body lurch a bit? Did you notice some part of your   body become more rigid, or a tightening of some muscle or group of muscles? My   experience has shown me that most people notice something in their legs, back or   abdomen first. Alexander&rsquo;s discovery of the primary control, however, would lead   us to expect there also to be a change in the relationship of our heads to our   bodies. Did you notice your head move, or your neck tighten a bit? Most people   do not notice that change at first because the other changes are much bigger. </p>
            <p>So, let&rsquo;s take another step. Please don&rsquo;t forget to really enjoy just   standing for awhile before you start the step. This time catch yourself as soon   as you know you have moved in response to the decision to take a step. Did you   notice yourself tighten your neck? If not, start again, always going back to   standing for a moment first. No matter what is noticed in response to deciding   to move, it seems always possible to wonder about what happened just before   that.</p>
            <p>There are a couple of things that can get in the way of this process. One is   the notion that there is a right way to take a step, or a right way to do   anything, for that matter. Oddly enough, worrying about the right way to do   something, or even thinking I know the right way to do something, can actually   prevent me from seeing what I am really doing. Because there are myriad   sensations that accompany any activity, if I am worried that I am not doing it   right, I can always find something that feels wrong. If I think I know the right   way, I can always find some sensation to prove to me that I have done it right.   If I really want to know what I am doing, I have found it best to forget my   preconceived notions about what is the right or wrong way to do it. On the other   hand it is possible to prefer one way of doing something to another, after the   alternatives have been experienced. </p>
            <p>With that bit of attention to possible obstacles done, let&rsquo;s get back to   taking a step.</p>
            <p>When you get to the point that you can actually feel yourself tightening your   neck as you begin to take a step, observe how a wave of tightening quickly   proceeds from your neck down through your body as you begin to take the step.   Repeat this a couple of times, always going back to standing quietly in between   repetitions. Observe the direction that your head and body move in response to   the tightening. In particular observe whether it is upward or downward. Because   muscles shorten when they tighten in response to my decision to take a step,   they in a sense pull the parts of my body down and together (i.e. towards each   other) as I start to move. Even the excess tension associated with what is   called "standing up straight" actually pulls the upper part of my back backwards   and down towards the lower part of my back. If the tension you have discovered   associated with taking a step doesn&rsquo;t feel like it is pulling you down, try out   this alternative way of thinking about it, and see if it makes sense. If it   does, does the way you feel the movement change?</p>
            <p>When what you are doing becomes clear to you, you can ask yourself if that   wave of tightening is really necessary. It usually feels absolutely necessary,   if you want to take a step, but it really isn&rsquo;t. When you become conscious of   tightening your neck, you begin to have a choice about doing it, but how can you   not do something that feels absolutely necessary and still take the step?   Another idea, and a spirit of adventure are a big help. </p>
            <p>So far you have observed what has happened when you proceeded from standing   to beginning to take a step. Then you went back to standing quietly. What   happens when you decide not to continue to take the step, but instead to go back   to standing? Chances are you didn&rsquo;t notice, but you can always repeat the   experiment. Did the tension associated with taking the step go away when you   went back to standing? What direction did your parts move when you returned to   standing? Was it an effortless movement upward to standing? If not, are you   doing anything different now because you are observing the process of returning   to standing? If observing it did change it, or you don&rsquo;t know, well, forget   about it, take a break, and start back at the beginning when you feel like it.   In fact I don&rsquo;t suggest anyone spend more than 5 minutes in this whole process.   If you notice at any point that you are getting stiff or have an ache or pain,   then I suggest a break, and forgetting about it for awhile. This process isn&rsquo;t   about learning to do anything right. It is about learning to observe ourselves   as lightly and simply as possible.</p>
            <p>When students do observe the downward pull associated with taking the step,   and the easy, upward return to standing, they usually prefer the latter feeling.   The usual tension associated with standing may not be any different, but the   easy movement back to standing is really pretty nice compared to the contraction   associated with beginning to take a step. If in your experiments you have gotten   this far, then the next suggestion is to ask yourself if that easy, upward   feeling of movement could continue while you take a step. Put another way, could   you continue with what you felt when giving up taking a step while taking a step   nevertheless? It will likely feel impossible, but, just for fun, consider the   possibility anyway. If it doesn&rsquo;t feel impossible, you might want to be a little   suspicious of what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re not doing anything right are you?</p>
            <p>Another suggestion that I have found helpful at this point is to think of   beginning the movement of taking the step by allowing your head to tilt very   slightly forward, a direction that, if it were to continue, would have you   looking toward your feet. Let this tilt of your head happen because you released   tension somewhere in your neck, and let it take you slightly off of your   balance. As you try this, if you make the tilt of your head so small you barely   know you have done it, then you won&rsquo;t end up looking down, especially if you   remember to continue with that easy, upward movement through your body. You   continue with that easy, upward movement by simply not interferring with it. You   actually have to do something to stop it, and virtually anything you actively do   will stop it. So, if you forget what that easy, upward movement is like, or if   you find yourself tugging at your head to make it tilt, you can always go back a   few paragraphs and begin again. You really can&rsquo;t make happen that easy upward   movement in the same way you are used to making other movements happen. It only   comes as the result of releasing the downward pressure habitually associated   with the movement. The slight forward tilt of your head, and projecting (by   deciding to continue it, even if it feels odd) the easy, upward movement of your   body allow you to continue to inhibit your habitual response to taking a step,   and nevertheless to take the step in a new way that can only be discovered as it   happens. </p>
            <p>When you are able to begin the step while continuing the easy, upward   movement and the slight forward tilt of your head, if you did nothing else you   would fall on your face. Instead allow one of your legs to move by moving your   knee forward so that your foot comes down under you. I suggest starting with   some baby steps, perhaps allowing your fingertips to rest lightly on a table top   or the back of a chair to aid your balance. I really can&rsquo;t tell you much more   about what to expect as you continue to walk - it always seems new to me. And   when you come back to standing after the step, observe how different that might   be from your usual way of standing. I hope you have some fun. </p>
            <p>I usually suggest that people not spend more than 5 minutes at a time working   this way. If you find yourself feeling stiff or having aches and pains, consider   that it might be your bodies way of telling you that you are trying to tell it   something right to do instead of observing what is happening, and discovering   something new. When I guide a student through this process in a class it usually   takes about 15 minutes, so if you are working alone, I suggest spreading out   these experiments over a few days. As you become familiar with the process, you   can go through the whole thing in a second or two. I find it great entertainment   while waiting for the bus or in a grocery store check out line. The movements   are so small that no one will notice what you are doing. Then when the bus comes   or it&rsquo;s your turn in line, take off, and let yourself be surprised about what   happens, and what you observe. </p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I would like to explain how the ideas presented earlier   about how we are organized are used in the process outlined above. First, we   decided to look at what changed when we went from standing to taking a step.   Second, we progressively made ourselves more sensitive to the movement by asking   ourselves to look closer and closer to the beginning of the movement. Third,   Alexander&rsquo;s idea of the primary control told us not to stop looking for the   beginning of the movement until we knew what happened to the relationship of our   heads to our bodies, i.e. until we could actually feel what happened in our   necks. It is really this third idea that allows the process to become objective.   And finally, in directing the movements of our heads and bodies in a new way as   we took the step, we asked that the movement we used to initiate the step be as   close to effortless as perceivable, so small that we barely knew we did   it.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
            <p>By working in the way outlined in the last section, I believe that we are   directing our attention to what is actually observable through a human body,   that is, change. We gradually return our attention to the undifferentiated   stream of flowing perception. Other ways of talking about movement, such as   paying attention to good posture, proper alignment, just relaxing, or images of   strings tied to our heads can sometimes be useful for motivating or encouraging   people to change. However, they all rely on an enormous number of preexisting   thought patterns that can color our perceptions of what we are actually doing,   and that impose prejudgements on our experience. By returning to what we can   actually perceive, we have a chance to make fresh choices about what we think   and do, free from preexisting conditions.</p>
            <p>As you review the experiences you had following the consciously guided   observation procedure, how would you describe the change in consciousness that   accompanied coming closer and closer to observing the moment that you initiated   movement? When you were able to continue with the step while your habitual   response remained inhibited, who was observing the movement, thinking the   directions, willing the movement? In my experience, at that moment, all three   processes blend into one. I don&rsquo;t think I could discriminate thinking, feeling   and willing into separate processes at that moment. As I begin to objectively   observe my thinking, feeling and willing, I begin to dissociate them from &lsquo;I&rsquo;   experiences - i.e. if I am not my thinking, feeling and/or willing, because I am   observing and directing them as they happen, then what does that leave? I don&rsquo;t   know, but it&rsquo;s not nothing, and it&rsquo;s no thing I can point to. </p>
            <p>If you review the process you went through, or if you do it again, notice   that what you start out feeling about a movement is by no means what you end up   feeling, i.e. your initially perceived feelings were not accurate (and never   will be). Also observe that you were willing movements without being aware of   it, so that the thoughts that led to the movements were unobserved, as were the   movements themselves. The habitual responses were determined by past experience,   with no choice on your part as long as they remained unobserved. The consciously   guided observation process uses thinking, feeling and willing in an iterative   process that continually moves the three closer and closer to being observed at   the same time, the moment the new movement begins. </p>
            <p>Our habitual responses are usually unobservered while they are happening. In   a sense we become partially unconscious during them. Therefore, the processes of   thinking, feeling and willing appear to be separated. We appear to ourselves to   first think about the movement, then do it, then feel the result of moving. That   moment of becoming unconscious, while we tighten our bodies to "get ready to   move," causes us to be unable to observe the unity of thinking, feeling, and of   will acting into us. </p>
          <p>As we are able to extend our consciousness more fully over more of our   activities, we become less bound by our conditioned habits of thinking and   doing, and are more able to gain access to new responses that more appropriately   fit the moment. </p></td>
