It was great to have six different but related perspectives on the work, including sessions that looked at participants' individual interests. I'm especially glad to have been able to continue the work at home, and apply what I encountered to my daily life and dance practice.The readings and discussions were really useful, deepening insight. A truly rewarding week!</font></p>            </td>

            I had an acquaintance with Alexander Technique. I didn't know what 
            awaited me. Eight days and seven different teachers later I had a 
            total new awareness of myself and how I move. Not only did I have 
            a new awareness, however, I had helpful, hands-on information about 
            how to evaluate my own body's particular dynamics and how to change 
            them. This all translates into more potential for myself. How much 
            better can it get? </font><br>

      combination of intensity and relaxation so that a great deal of 
      learning takes place without the participants' becoming fatigued. 
      The value of working with several instructors each with their individual 
      emphases and insights, but none rigidly insisting on his or her 
      own approach cannot be overstated. The opportunity to talk informally 
      with the instructors at meals and during periods of unstructured 
      time is invaluable as well. </font></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The small group work is extremely effective. The Institute has 
            made me a staunch believer in this approach to the learning of the 
            Alexander Technique. On both a personal and professional level The 
            Barstow/Alexander Summer Institute is one of the wisest choices 
          for growth I have ever made. </font></p></td>

    <td><p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was great to to have the chance to attend the Alexander Institute(AI) 
      at Doane College last week. I feel very lucky to have been able 
      to participate in this special event and to have had the opportunity 
      to study with such knowledgeable and skillful teachers. The AI presented 
      valuable information about the use of the body in a setting that 
      allows one to take it in, contemplate it, and practice it. Since 
      attending this institute, my level of awareness about my use has 
      grown. I'm also noticing more about other people's use, which is 
      not something one does in order to make a judgment about another. 
      Rather, it's useful to have a conscious awareness of how others 
      are using themselves so that one does not subconsciously emulate 
      another's misuse of the body. This awareness allows one to make 
      permanent positive changes in ones own use. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the changes in use I'd been wanting to make was in my 
        walking because I had been having foot pain. The foot pain was from 
        tendonitis and bursitis caused by walking incorrectly. I was able 
        to get a lot of help related to this specific need that enabled 
        me to gain insight into what I was doing and to change it. My walking 
        has improved, and the pain in my foot has diminished greatly. If 
        I find that I am having foot pain again, I'm able to make the necessary 
        changes in walking and use that allow that pain to stop.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I would highly recommend this Institute and these teachers 
    to anyone interested in studying the Alexander Technique. </font></p></td>
