      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The summer institute was a wonderful week-long immersion into 
            the Alexander Technique allowing me to take home some well-learned 
            and integrated concepts. The structure of the workshop provided lots 
            of individual and small group attention making it accessible to people 
            of all skill levels. I enjoyed being exposed to a variety of teachers 
            with different styles and background. I especially enjoyed the atmosphere 
            of acceptance and support created by the teachers. This workshop was 
            the highlight of my summer and quite a bargain, as well, for all the 
      learning and skills I gained. </font></p>

I walked pain-free for the first time in four months.</font></td>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been studying the F. M. Alexander Technique for seventeen 
              years with Marjorie Barstow and her assistants. I have watched, 
              with increasing admiration, the maturation of teaching skills of 
              all the teachers at the Barstow Institute at Doane College. In four 
              days, I found myself learning more than I had ever dreamed possible 
              about the application of the technique both to my own activities 
              and especially to the ineffable problem of getting along in a group.              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a non-guru workshop, and therein lies its brilliance 
              and effectiveness. A marvelous synergy emanates from the relationships 
              between teachers and students. The effect is heightened by the venue; 
              I consider Doane College to have one of the loveliest campuses in 
              America. After class, we would watch swans exhibit beautiful use 
              in the water! </font><br>

            Technique Institute, was one of the best experiences of my life! Heartfelt 
            thanks to the entire staff of Alexander teachers for helping me expand 
            my mind-and-body awareness. I am enthusiastically experimenting with 
            the Alexander principles in my singing and horseback riding and in 
          daily life in general.</font></td>

    <td width="76%"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been curious about the Alexander Technique for 2 years. 
      During this time I had put off taking any action outside of reading. 
      I needed a vacation and saw the posting for the Seminar. This was 
      as good a time as any to actually try the Alexander Technique. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was not disappointed on either account. It was a great vacation 
        and a phenomenal learning experience. The Doane College site is 
        very peaceful with ponds, swans and rolling lawns. The food and 
        amenities were excellent and the staff made any resources of the 
        College available with generous hospitality. The participants came 
        from all walks of life and levels of experience with the technique. 
        This showed a depth and universality I had only suspected was possible. 
        Working with 5 different teachers in small groups assured that all 
        who came found an approach that could be understood in their life. At times there were multiple teachers in a small group which 
        presented some unique opportunities. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My favorite lesson was when someone wanted to practice a reading 
        for church. She needed a lectern which was not in that area so, 
        someone volunteered to be the lectern. The 'lectern' got a lesson 
        in a static posture and the speaker got 2 lessons. One from another 
        teacher on her use in speaking and one from the 'lectern' on her 
        use of the lectern. A truly unique lesson that was a lot of fun 
        to watch. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I strongly recommend this seminar to anyone who is interested 
    in the Alexander Technique. </font></p></td>
