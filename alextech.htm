            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">The Alexander 
              Technique is a simple, practical method for learning to improve 
              freedom and ease of movement while regaining natural coordination. 
              The Technique teaches the use of the appropriate amount of effort 
              for a particular activity, giving you more energy for all your activities.

              Marjorie Barstow was an innovative teacher of the Alexander Technique. 
              Her style of teaching was light, precise, and joyful. She asked 
              her students to take an active part in the learning process; to 
              think, to experiment, and to stick to the principles discovered 
              by F.M. Alexander. What she did to help students apply Alexander's 
              discoveries seemed created in the moment, specifically for that 
              student and situation. She always sought simpler, more practical 
              ways to communicate her understanding and love of the Technique, 
              and the teachers at the Barstow Institute feel happily challenged 
              to continue her tradition.</p>
