            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having never met Marj Barstow, I can only imagine the special 
              qualities that brought out teachers and others back to study with 
              her year after year after year. All six teachers possess a common 
              thread of greatness in sharing this knowledge with patience, encouragement, 
              and open hearts. I’m deeply thankful that I yielded to the impulse 
              to attend the Institute. What an incredible introduction to the 
              Alexander Technique!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I find I’m warning myself that future experiences other than 
              the Barstow Institute may not be quite so satisfying as studying 
              with Marj’s “progeny.&quot; 
              Many thanks for an incredible, profound, earth-shaking, simple, 
              basic, free-neck week! </font><br>

            helped me to improve and refine my thinking process with the work. 
            I feel like my ability to teach groups and individuals has really 
            grown. I highly recommend the workshop to anyone, teachers or students,

    <td><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Barstow/Alexander Institute in Crete, Nebraska, at Doane 
      College was one of the best, if not the best arranged workshops 
      I've attended. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The superbly organized seven and half day Institute offered 
        a variety of large and small group sessions in diverse locations. 
        The schedule kept us alert with no time to get bored or distracted! </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We met, for example, in a dorm lounge, in dorm rooms, in a class 
        room, on stage, on a balcony, under the trees, and in a rose garden 
        to name a few places. At times all the participants met together. 
        Other times we met in small groups of three or four. The private 
        individual sessions with an instructor proved to be especially valuable. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the organization of the workshop, the seven instructors 
        each could be considered master teachers. They kept the groups on 
        track, guided the learning with skill, and kept the focus on the 
        topic at hand. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Combine organization and instructor skill with interesting participants 
        and a delightful wooded setting of a lake, swans, raccoons, rabbits, 
        birds of all kinds, and deer, plus a friendly, helpful college staff, 
        and what more could you want? Fun? We had that too--a talent show, 
        a trip to Lincoln, star gazing, and so much more. This Institute 
    was first-rate! </font></p></td>
